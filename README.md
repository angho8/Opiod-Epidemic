This project investigates the ongoing opioid epidemic, focusing on trends in deaths and death rates from 2018 to 2022. 
Using CDC Wonder data and R's tidyverse packages, it analyzes variations in races, age groups, and regions. 
The project unveils "other synthetic narcotics" as the primary contributor to the crisis, with the South emerging as a notable hotspot. 
Visualizations, including bar graphs, boxplots, and line plots, provide nuanced insights, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies. 
The analysis prompts policymakers and healthcare professionals to adopt evidence-based interventions in addressing the severity of the opioid epidemic.
